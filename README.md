 Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Rays using Deep Learning

A deep learning system that automatically detects pneumonia from chest X-ray images with high accuracy, assisting radiologists in medical diagnosis.

##  Project Overview

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify chest X-ray images as "Normal" or "Pneumonia". The system aims to support healthcare professionals by providing rapid, automated preliminary diagnosis.

##  Features

- High Accuracy Classification: Distinguishes between normal and pneumonia chest X-rays
- Data Augmentation: Enhanced generalization with random rotations, flips, and transformations
- PyTorch Implementation: Efficient deep learning pipeline
- Comprehensive Evaluation: Detailed metrics and visualization tools

## Dataset

-The project uses the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset containing:
-5,863 X-ray images (JPEG format)
-2 categories: Normal (1,349) vs Pneumonia (4,514)
-Train/Validation/Test splits included
